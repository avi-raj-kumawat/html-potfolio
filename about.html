<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  
  Hi there! I’m AVIRAJ KUMAWAT , a passionate web designer dedicated to creating visually captivating and user-friendly digital experiences.
  
  With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in crafting clean, responsive designs that not only look great but also function seamlessly across all devices. My design approach is centered around understanding user needs and translating them into intuitive, engaging interfaces.
  
  I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of creativity and technology, and web design perfectly embodies that synergy. I’m constantly exploring the latest trends and tools to push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web, while ensuring that each project I work on is both innovative and practical.
  
  When I’m not designing, you might find me exploring the latest design trends, experimenting with new techniques, or enjoying [a personal hobby or interest, e.g., hiking, reading, or cooking]. I’m excited to bring my enthusiasm and skills to new projects and collaborate with others to create exceptional digital experiences.
  
  Feel free to reach out if you’d like to work together or just chat about web design!</p>
